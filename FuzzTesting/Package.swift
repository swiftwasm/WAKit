        // Discussion: Why we build libraries instead of executables linking libFuzzer?
        //
        // First, libclang_rt.fuzzer.a defines the main function for the fuzzing process
        // and object files given by the user are expected not to have a "main" function
        // to avoid conflicts.
        // Fortunately, SwiftPM asks the compiler frontend to define the main entrypoint as
        // `<module_name>_main` for testing executable targets (`-entry-point-function-name`)
        // so object files of `executableTarget` targets are capable of being linked with
        // libclang_rt.fuzzer.a.
        // However, at link-time, SwiftPM asks the linker to rename the `<module_name>_main`
        // symbol back to `main` for the final executable (`--defsym main=<module_name>_main`)
        // and gold linker respects the renamed "main" symbol rather than the one defined in
        // libclang_rt.fuzzer.a, so the final executable does not start the fuzzing process.
        //
        // Instead of relying on the SwiftPM's linking process, we build libraries defining
        // fuzzing target functions and manually link them with fuzzing runtime libraries.
