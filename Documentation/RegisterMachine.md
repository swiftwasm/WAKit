# Register-based Interpreter Design

## Introduction

This document describes the design and rationale of the WasmKit register-based interpreter. The interpreter is designed to be reasonably fast and memory-efficient without sacrificing the simplicity of the codebase.

## Interpreter History

**First Generation**

The original interpreter of WasmKit interpreted structured WebAssembly instructions directly without any intermediate representation. The interpreter used a switch-case statement to dispatch the execution of each instruction and every block/loop/if instruction had its own stack frame. The interpreter was simple and easy to understand, but it was slow and memory-inefficient.

**Second Generation**

The second generation[^1] added a thin translation pass that converted WebAssembly instructions into a stack-based linear intermediate representation. The translation pass pre-computed stack-height information and branch offsets to simplify branch handling. Those information were computed by abstractly interpreting the WebAssembly instructions while doing the [validation](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/index.html) step.

The second generation interpreter significantly improved the branching performance and resulted in ~5x speedup compared to the first generation interpreter.

## Motivation

The second generation interpreter was a significant improvement over the first generation, but it was still not fast enough to run [some of exhaustive test suites of Swift Standard Library](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/tree/main/test/stdlib).

Based on the profiling results, the interpreter was spending over 60% of the time in `local.get`, and `{i32,i64,f32,f64}.const` instructions. Those instructions frequently appear when lowering LLVM IR to WebAssembly without the [Register Stackification pass](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-18.1.8/llvm/lib/Target/WebAssembly/WebAssemblyRegStackify.cpp), which is usually applied only when `-O` optimization enabled, and the most of the Swift Standard Library tests are compiled without `-O`.

According to "A Fast WebAssembly Interpreter Design in WASM-Micro-Runtime" [^2], the described register-based interpreter design can remove "provider" instructions (e.g., `local.get`, `{i32,i64,f32,f64}.const`) during the translation step and embed register information directly into "consumer" instructions (e.g., `i32.add`, `call`, etc.).

The register-based interpreter design is expected to reduce the number of instructions executed and improve the performance of the interpreter, especially for non-optimized WebAssembly code.

## Design Overview

TBD

### Stack frame layout

See doc comments on `StackLayout` type. The stack frame layout design is heavily inspired by stitch WebAssembly interpreter[^4].

### TODO

- Variadic width instructions
- Constant pool space on stack
  - Trade space and time on prologue for time by fewer instructions
  - |locals|dynamic stack| -> |locals|dynamic stack|constant|
- Stack caching
- Instruction fusion
  - Const embedding
  - Conditional embedding (eg. br_if_lt)
